# CIS30C_CourseProject

This is a very simple project assessing a static web server.  Modules nmap, logging, socket, requests, and hashlib were the modules learned in this course and used in the project.  

The project tasks were to assess vulnerability on a HTTP server, monitor HTTP server communication, connectivity, and security, and manage HTTP server logs containing event information, warnings, and errors.  

The submissions consist of 3 files: the server script, the vulnerability assessment script and the monitoring script.  A one page summary report is included. Another file contains screenshots of script output and of the 2 log files, one from the server and one from the monitor.
